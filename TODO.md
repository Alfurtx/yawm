# TODO

- [x] delete windows
- [x] move windows in the tile
- [x] add ICCM and EWMH support
- [x] issue: neovide and google (and possibly other apps) don't open
        solved: it only proves to be an issue in Xephyr because testing in live has proved to work just fine
- [ ] create/delete/go through multiple workspaces
- [ ] add multimonitor support
- [ ] issue with character like '[', ']', ':' and probably others
- [ ] issue with click processing
- [ ] add top statusbar
- [ ] add gaps(?)
- [ ] add autostart script for other apps
- [ ] refactor monitor with manager.monitors
